Not all supplements work for everyone, so allowing a trial period is a good business practice. I contacted Populum to inquire about taking advantage of the trial period. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease with which they honored the request. They simply confirmed my information the sent me a prepaid shipping label. I gave Populum five stars for honoring their promise to refund the cost if it didn&apos;t work. A rare practice these days!</p>

                                                Not all bodies are the same. CBD oil is still a new product for most people, and first-timers will have no idea whether or not CBD oil can give them their desired results. We also know that our customers are putting a lot of faith in us. Our goal is to deliver on that faith through quality products, and we want to give you the chance to test that out before making a decision.
